This is a number of shapes to be used for creating OPM (Object Process
Methodology) diagrams in Dia.

Installation: 
=============
Just unzip dia_OPM.zip in the .dia directory.


Potential issues: 
=================

Issue:The default sizes of the symbols are not as you want them.

Fix: open the defaults.dia file in the .dia directory in a text editor
and change the height for the OPM symbols to 1 for the structural
relations and whatever you feel like for the others.
